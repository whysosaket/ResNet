It is also important to remember that you are not alone and help is available.\\n\\nThe most important thing to do in this situation is to get out of the house as quickly and safely as possible. If you can, try to stay low to the ground and cover your mouth and nose with a wet cloth or towel to protect yourself from smoke inhalation. If you can, try to close any doors behind you to help contain the fire.\\n\\nIf you can, try to find an exit that is not blocked by fire or smoke. If you cannot find an exit, try to find a room with a window and break it to get out. If you cannot find a window, try to find a safe place to wait for help.\\n\\nOnce you are out of the house, call 911 or your local emergency services for help.\\n\\nIt is also important to remember to stay away from the house and not to go back inside.\\n\\nFinally, if you have any questions or need any additional help, please do not hesitate to reach out to your local emergency services.'"
